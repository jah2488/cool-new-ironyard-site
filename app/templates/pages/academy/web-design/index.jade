          | Over the course of three months, a practicing web designer (and skilled instructor) will show you the multiple facets of being a web designer, including creative discovery and ideation, design principles, coding in HTML, CSS, and interaction-based Javascript and responsive Web Design. At the end of the class, you’ll be equipped with portfolio of web design projects built from scratch and looking beautiful. <br><br>
          | The best part: we’ll help you get a job offer as a web designer when you graduate. Don’t know any code? Don’t worry. Our proven teachers and process will take you from zero to hero and mentor you into a professional junior-level web designer.

The schedule is set up like a typical five-day work week, with lecture in the morning and lab time in the afternoon. Friday is an open lab day where students can work with the instructor to catch up on projects or get a head start on the weekend’s homework.

        p Our lessons are fast-paced, interactive and fun. All of our instructors use a hands-on, live-coding lecture style so that students immediately start developing muscle memory for each new skill. We cover a new subject almost every day, building on previous material. The goal is for you to get your hands dirty absorbing a whole lot of information, then apply it on a real project during lab.

        p You’ll have homework every single day…and it ain’t easy. All assignments are cumulative and ultimately lead up to a final project (unique to each student) that is the crown of your portfolio. If that doesn’t keep you busy enough, we start sending you <em>real, paid freelance work</em>. You’ll have access to the space 24 hours a day, just in case you need to burn some midnight oil.

We also partner with guest speakers who cover a variety of topics like responsive web design and freelancing, and we take class field trips to real businesses like MailChimp and BMW. Employers have told us our grads are some of the most well-rounded, teachable hires they’ve ever made

        p
          | Just knowing punctuation doesn’t make you a great writer. In the same sense, just knowing HTML and CSS doesn’t make you great at designing websites; that’s the easy part of web design. The emphasis in all of our classes is on helping you think like a designer. Web Design is a lifelong study, and our goal is for you to learn how to learn so you remain highly valuable for the rest of your career.<br><br>
          | That being said, you’ll leave our class with a toolbox of skills that will set you far apart from other junior-level web designers. You’ll cover an incredible amount of ground in 3 months, from foundational design concepts to complex interactive JavaScript. Some topics like responsive web design will take weeks to cover, while others like Sass pre-processing will be taught in just a few lectures. Each instructor and class stays agile so that the curriculum can adapt as tools and languages evolve, but we ensure that each student graduates with the same core skillset.<br><br>
          | No matter your learning pace, we keep our class sizes small so that we can spend individual time with each student and make sure no one falls behind.

            | <strong>Design Principles</strong><br>
            | Students learn fundamentals in grid, typography, color theory, branding and templating, and how these elements form a cohesive system.<br><br>

            | <strong>Building Responsive Sites</strong><br>
            | We teach media queries and responsive design early and require almost all assignments to be fully functional across all screen sizes.<br><br>

            | We'll teach you how to produce images and media files for sites and clients that look great and load quickly.<br><br>
            | <strong>Testing and Deployment</strong><br>
            | We'll teach you how to test your projects on multiple browsers and devices, as well as how to deploy them.<br><br>

            | Seasoned pros show you how to find good work, write contracts and proposals, set expectations, price well and communicate like a pro.<br><br>
            | <strong>Getting Hired</strong><br>

          | Before we get into specifics, we need to let you know that this class is going to be very challenging. The material gets really hard, really fast. All of the work is very do-able, but if you think you’re going to develop professional level skills in a cushy 40 hour week, this isn’t the place for you. (The average student puts in about 60 hours per week, minimum). We don’t require you to know code to start with, but you need to have tried it and enjoyed it. If that’s you, go ahead and <a href="#class-schedule">apply now</a>. If not, <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">try a few exercises to see</a>.<br><br>
          | We’re family people, so our goal is for you to work as hard as possible in class so you can find joy in a great job, freelance work, or starting your own company when you’re done. We’re proud of all of the different types of people who have come through The Iron Yard, and we don’t have stereotypes of what a programmer is like. We’ve taught students from 18 to 50 years old, from different countries and all sorts of backgrounds.

          | <strong>Works Well With Others</strong><br>

          | <strong>Interested in Learning</strong><br>
          | Even if you know basics (or more), you might have to unlearn some things. We’ll start from the ground up as a team, and there won’t be room for egos.<br><br>
          | <strong>Graceful Problem Solver</strong><br>
          | We’ll work on some hard, frustrating stuff. Patience and endurance are necessities.<br><br>
          | <strong>Ready to Have Fun</strong><br>
