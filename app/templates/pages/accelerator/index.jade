      | It's a secret sauce with two ingredients.
      |<br><br> <strong> The first is our network of mentors.</strong> CEOs and investors are must-haves, but they’re not the only ingredients to success. We partner with specialists in marketing, design, community management, and other disciplines to offer truly well-rounded support.
      |<br><br> <strong> The second is The Iron Yard community.</strong> Along with supportive alumni (in the same town), our program is located in a space that provides coworking for all sorts of professionals, intensive code education, and hosts nationally-known technology and design events.
